the forbidden one

Enhanced port of JayFoxRox's (aka jefe) magnum opus RSBS to the Nintendo GameCube using the devkitPPC toolchain.

As of now it's mostly an edit of the devkitPRO gxSprites example. I don't know much about the GX API and documentation is scarce so this will do for now :>

After all, you don't come here for quality stuff, do you?
